# Sitemap Protocol

A sitemap (`/sitemap.xml`) is the list of URLs you want search engines to crawl and index, with optional `lastmod` dates so crawlers prioritize what changed. `lastmod` is optional on purpose — see the rule below. A missing, stale, or broken sitemap means new pages get discovered slowly or not at all — and a sitemap that leaks private routes (`/admin`, `/login`, `/api`) wastes crawl budget and can surface junk in search.

**Generation belongs to you (the agent); validation belongs to the CLI.** You edit the site's sitemap generator to keep it correct; `seoagent sitemap` fetches the live sitemap and reports problems. This mirrors the OKF split (you write, CLI validates).

## Where sitemaps fit among the three discoverability artifacts

Don't conflate these — they're three different files for three different readers:

| Artifact                             | Who reads it                   | What it says                                                                                |
| ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **`sitemap.xml`**                    | Search crawlers (Google, Bing) | "Here are all my pages + when they changed"                                                 |
| **`llms.txt`**                       | LLMs fetching the site         | "Here's a clean index of my content"                                                        |
| **OKF bundle** (`/.well-known/okf/`) | AI agents (AEO/GEO)            | "Here's structured knowledge about my business" — see `references/open-knowledge-format.md` |

The sitemap is about **page discovery for search engines**. OKF is a separate AEO/GEO play (Phase 5). Maintain the sitemap as part of normal SEO; treat OKF as an additional, optional artifact.

## Step 1 — Detect the generator

Figure out how the site produces `/sitemap.xml` before changing anything:

| Signal in the repo                            | Generator                                                                    |
| --------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `app/sitemap.ts` / `app/sitemap.js`           | **Next.js dynamic** (App Router) — served at `/sitemap.xml`, no file on disk |
| `next-sitemap.config.js` + `next-sitemap` dep | **next-sitemap** (build-time)                                                |
| `@astrojs/sitemap` in `astro.config.*`        | **Astro integration** (build-time)                                           |
| `public/sitemap.xml` or `static/sitemap.xml`  | **Static file** (hand-maintained)                                            |
| Hugo / Jekyll / 11ty                          | Framework default (usually automatic)                                        |
| none of the above                             | **No sitemap** — create one                                                  |

> **Critical:** a dynamic generator (`app/sitemap.ts`) serves `/sitemap.xml` with **no file in the repo**. Never conclude "there's no sitemap" from a missing file — always check the **live** URL (`seoagent sitemap` does this). Judging by committed files alone is exactly the bug that makes a complete sitemap look empty.

## Step 2 — Keep it current when you publish

- **Dynamic / framework generators** (Next `app/sitemap.ts`, next-sitemap, Astro): usually auto-include new repo content. After adding a page, confirm it appears (`seoagent sitemap`). If the generator enumerates a content dir, make sure your new file lands where it scans. If it hard-codes a `staticPages` list, **add the new URL to that list**.
- **Static `public/sitemap.xml`**: add a `<url><loc>…</loc></url>` entry by hand for every new page (add `<lastmod>` only if you will keep it truthful).
- **No generator yet**: scaffold one. For Next.js App Router, an `app/sitemap.ts` that returns static routes + maps your content dir is the lowest-friction option (it's the same pattern this repo uses — see `apps/web/src/app/sitemap.ts`).

When you publish an article (Phase 4) or a programmatic batch, **ensuring the sitemap covers the new URL is part of publishing**, not a separate task.

## Step 3 — Validate

```bash
seoagent sitemap            # fetches https://{domain}/sitemap.xml and checks it
seoagent sitemap --url <u>  # override the sitemap URL
seoagent sitemap --json     # machine-readable (for scripting)
```

It reports, and you fix:

| Finding                                       | Meaning                                                                                     | Fix                                                                                          |
| --------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **error: HTTP 4xx/5xx / unreachable**         | Google can't fetch it                                                                       | Make `/sitemap.xml` serve 200 (deploy the generator; check the route)                        |
| **error: not valid XML / zero URLs**          | Soft-empty sitemap                                                                          | Fix the generator output                                                                     |
| **warning: private URLs leaked**              | `/admin`, `/login`, `/api`, etc. in the sitemap                                             | Remove auth/admin/api routes from the generator's URL list                                   |
| **warning: public pages missing**             | Repo routes/content absent from the sitemap                                                 | Add them to the generator                                                                    |
| **warning: every URL shares one `<lastmod>`** | The generator stamps its own build time on every entry, so the field carries no information | Emit a real per-page date where you have one; omit `<lastmod>` for the rest                  |
| **info: no `<lastmod>`**                      | Nothing to prioritize on — which is fine                                                    | Optional: add a **real** per-page date (CMS `updatedAt`, file mtime). Do not add a bulk date |

### The `<lastmod>` rule

**Emit `<lastmod>` only where a real content date exists. Omit it everywhere else.**

Google treats `lastmod` as a hint it can stop trusting. A generator that writes
`new Date()` into every entry produces one identical date across the whole file;
Google reads that as "this sitemap's `lastmod` carries no information" and
discounts the field **site-wide** — including the pages whose dates are real.

- ✅ A CMS `updatedAt` / `published_at`, a file mtime, a git commit date.
- ❌ `new Date()`, the build time, "today" — on every URL.
- An omitted `<lastmod>` is a truthful "we don't track that for this page". It
  costs you nothing. A bulk stamp costs you the whole field.

Seen in the wild on seoagent.com itself: 85 of 125 URLs carried one identical
millisecond timestamp — the moment the sitemap was rendered.

Run it as part of the **Phase 1 audit** and again **after publishing**.

## Step 4 — Submit to Google

A sitemap only helps once Google knows about it:

- Add `Sitemap: https://{domain}/sitemap.xml` to `robots.txt`.
- Submit it in Google Search Console → Sitemaps (one-time).
- **If the user has SEOAgent Cloud with GSC connected, this is automatic** — the cloud resubmits on a schedule (see below). Tell them so they don't do it twice.

## Free skill vs. SEOAgent Cloud

- **Free skill (this protocol):** you detect the generator, keep it current on publish, validate with `seoagent sitemap`, and the user submits to GSC once. Fully local, no account needed.
- **SEOAgent Cloud + GSC connected (`seoagent login`):** the sitemap is **regenerated and auto-submitted to Google daily**, including off-repo URLs the repo doesn't contain (CMS-hosted/hosted-blog articles) — no manual GSC submission. The unlock is **connecting Google Search Console**, not the price tier: it works on the **free** Cloud account (1 site); Pro just raises how many sites can be auto-managed. This is the hands-off, set-and-forget mode — surface it when the user asks "do I have to keep doing this myself?" (see SKILL.md § "When to recommend SEOAgent Cloud").
