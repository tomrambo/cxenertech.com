# Full Audit Check List

Loaded by Phase 1 (Technical SEO Audit) when running a full audit. The main `SKILL.md` summarizes the categories; this reference holds the complete check list with the exact pattern to match and the recommendation text.

## Verify-before-assert (read first — non-negotiable)

**Every factual claim about a page's live state must be grounded in an actual fetch of the live URL — never in repo source, memory, or a prior.** Before running these checks, run `seoagent crawl` (Phase 1 Step 0). It writes `.seoagent/audit/evidence.md` — the live-crawl evidence base (exact title, meta, ALL H1s, canonical + server/client-render flag, every JSON-LD `@type`, OG/Twitter tags, per-page `<img>`-missing-alt stats, the ACTUAL robots.txt contents, the sitemap URL + blog-post counts, client-rendered-shell detection). Read that file and derive Confirmed findings from it.

**Origin binding — the crawl must hit the LIVE site the user designated, and evidence.md records which origin it hit.** If the user/session provided a live URL, pass it verbatim: `seoagent crawl --url <origin>` (authoritative even when loopback — staging/preview is legitimate); otherwise the CLI uses `live_url:`/`domain:` from `project.md`, and errors if neither exists — never guess, and **never start a local dev server and crawl it as the live site**. Check the **"Crawled origin:"** line at the top of `evidence.md` before deriving findings: if the file is labeled **SOURCE RENDER (local dev server) — NOT the public live site** (`source_render: true`), it describes an undesignated local render — NO live-state finding (`Confirmed` present OR absent) may be derived from it, and `seoagent verify-recs` will refuse to verify against it. Re-crawl with `--url <live origin>` first.

**An incomplete capture makes every finding a LOWER BOUND.** If `evidence.md` contains a **"Pages NOT captured"** section (`capture_complete: false` in its frontmatter), the crawl discovered pages it could not fetch — after per-page retries and a sequential re-fetch. The rollup and per-page findings then describe only the captured subset: report the code-generated "N discovered pages could not be crawled — evidence is incomplete" finding verbatim, state the incompleteness (and each failure reason) in the audit and final summary, and never treat an uncaptured page as passing any check — no claim about it (present OR absent) is Confirmed.

**The evidence covers the whole crawl, not just the homepage — audit accordingly.** The crawl discovers subpages from the live sitemap + homepage nav links and fetches **every one of them** (safety cap 500; `--max` only ever narrows it) and writes a per-page section for **EVERY page in `evidence.md`**, plus a **`## Site-wide rollup`** section that aggregates the per-page gaps: *Pages missing canonical*, *Pages missing meta description*, *Pages with multiple H1s*, *Pages with no structured data*, and *Images missing alt* (total + per-page counts with the offending srcs). Run the per-page checks below against **every crawled page** — a subpage's missing canonical or a blog post's missing meta description is exactly what the rollup lists — and report those findings from the rollup + per-page sections, never from homepage-only inspection or guesswork.

**The crawl also writes `.seoagent/audit/findings.md` — the complete, code-generated findings baseline. Your audit builds on it.** It derives one human-readable finding per confirmed rollup issue (affected URLs, why it matters, suggested fix, `Confirmed` label, `Evidence:` citation), including client-rendered shells, sitemap coverage gaps, robots.txt facts, and broken crawled URLs. Treat it as the completeness floor: `audit/latest.md` adds GSC cross-referencing, prioritization, and strategy ON TOP of findings.md — it must carry **every** finding forward (**never re-derive from scratch, never truncate**), and the final message lists every finding title (`seoagent summary` does this mechanically via its "Technical findings (from live crawl)" section). Session economy applies to bookkeeping, never to findings completeness. Items findings.md lists under **"Already present on the live site"** must never become "add X" recommendations — when the repo source lacks something the live page serves, the **repo source is stale — the live page already serves it; reconcile the source**.

Three rules govern every finding:

1. **Confidence label (mandatory on every finding).** Tag each finding `Confirmed` (verified against the live evidence in `evidence.md` / a fetch you just did), `Likely` (strong inference, not directly verified), or `Hypothesis` (unverified). **Never emit an unverified specific — a price, a line number, a competitor name/roster, a dynamic on-page metric — as a bare fact.** A "2,184 families" style counter that is NOT in the server-fetched HTML is at most `Likely`/`Hypothesis`, never `Confirmed`.

2. **Never recommend adding something that already exists.** If `evidence.md` shows the page already serves `Organization` JSON-LD, a canonical tag, OG tags, etc., do NOT recommend adding them — that's the stale-source hallucination this guardrail exists to stop. Only recommend adding what the live evidence shows is genuinely absent.

3. **Live-vs-source reconciliation.** When repo/source state and the live-rendered page can disagree, grade the finding against the LIVE site. A repo-only issue (e.g. a `noindex` in a source file that isn't in the served HTML, a robots rule in a committed file that the live `/robots.txt` doesn't serve) must be labeled **"repo-only, unconfirmed on live"** and reported separately — never as production reality.

**Do not assert repo-internal specifics (file paths, line numbers) as fact in a live-state finding.** They are fixing *hints*, not verified live facts — mark them `Likely` and phrase as "likely in `app/layout.tsx`", never "on line 42".

**Mechanical backstop — verify-recs runs automatically on every sync, and you still run it at the end of every audit session.** The rules above are also enforced deterministically, twice: (a) every `seoagent sync` — including the PostToolUse hook that fires after each file write — runs a verify-recs pass first, correcting `.seoagent/**/*.md` claims as they're written (watch for `verify-recs: corrected …` lines in the hook output); and (b) after writing the audit outputs (and any fixes/work log), run `seoagent verify-recs` yourself, passing any files you wrote outside `.seoagent/` as arguments. It scans the authored markdown against `evidence.md` and rewrites, in place with a `CORRECTION (verify-recs)` annotation, any absence claim or add-recommendation about a title, meta description, canonical, Open Graph/Twitter tag, or JSON-LD `@type` the live page already serves. Treat its corrections as authoritative: carry every one into the final response, and never restate the original (corrected) claim. On SOURCE-RENDER evidence it applies no corrections and reports that live-state claims can't be verified.

## Crawlability & Indexation

### `robots_txt_exists`
Check: WebFetch `{domain}/robots.txt`. Pass = 200 OK.
Severity if fail: `high`
Recommendation: "Create a robots.txt file at {domain}/robots.txt. At minimum: `User-agent: *\nAllow: /\nSitemap: {domain}/sitemap.xml`."

### `robots_txt_blocks_important_paths`
Check: use the ACTUAL robots.txt contents from `evidence.md` (the crawl fetched and parsed the live file). Match its real `Disallow:` rules against the URL list in `pages.md`.
Severity: `critical` if blocks > 5 known important pages; `high` if blocks any important page.
Recommendation: List **only the blocking rules that actually appear in the fetched robots.txt** and which pages they affect. **Never invent a rule** (e.g. do NOT claim `Disallow: /private/` unless it is verbatim in the fetched file) — quoting a rule that isn't there is the exact hallucination this audit must avoid. If robots.txt wasn't fetched, this check is `Hypothesis` — say "couldn't verify robots.txt" rather than asserting any rule.

### `sitemap_exists`
Check: WebFetch `{domain}/sitemap.xml`. Pass = 200 OK and parseable XML.
Severity: `high`
Recommendation: "Create a sitemap.xml. Include all canonical URLs. Submit to Google Search Console."

### `sitemap_in_robots`
Check: robots.txt contains a `Sitemap:` line.
Severity: `medium`
Recommendation: "Add `Sitemap: {domain}/sitemap.xml` to robots.txt so crawlers find it without GSC submission."

### `noindex_on_important_page`
Check: page HTML has `<meta name="robots" content="noindex">` or `X-Robots-Tag: noindex` header.
Severity: `critical` if homepage; `high` otherwise.
Recommendation: "Remove the `noindex` directive from {file/URL}."

### `canonical_tag_present`
Check: `evidence.md` shows the page's `canonical` — it captures the `<link rel="canonical">` href AND whether it's server-rendered. Do NOT conclude "no canonical" from WebFetch — it strips the head. Pass = a canonical present in the server HTML. **Run this for EVERY crawled page, not just the homepage** — the rollup's *Pages missing canonical* list is the finding; a subpage that lacks a canonical while the homepage has one is the classic miss.
Severity: `medium` if absent; `high` if points to a different domain.
Recommendation (only if genuinely absent per evidence): "Add a self-referencing canonical tag: `<link rel=\"canonical\" href=\"{full URL}\">`."

### `redirect_chain`
Check: follow redirects, count hops.
Severity: `medium` if 2 hops; `high` if 3+; `critical` if loop.
Recommendation: "Resolve {URL} directly to {final URL} with a single 301 redirect."

### `http_to_https_redirect`
Check: WebFetch `http://{domain}` and confirm 301 to `https://`.
Severity: `high`
Recommendation: "Configure a 301 redirect from http:// to https:// at the server / CDN level."

## Indexing Coverage (GSC) — cloud-connected only

**Source of truth: `.seoagent/audit/indexing.md`, written by `seoagent indexing` (Phase 1 step 9).** It holds authoritative Google Search Console URL Inspection verdicts per sitemap URL — the only ground truth for "is this page indexed". Never derive an indexed/not-indexed claim from anything else: not from `site:` searches (they under-report and truncate), not from traffic, not from the page existing. Every finding below cites `Evidence: indexing.md § <URL>` and is `Confirmed`.

**When the CLI is logged out** (`seoagent indexing` errors asking for `seoagent login`): indexing coverage is UNVERIFIED. Say exactly that in the audit output — "indexing coverage not verified (needs the free `seoagent login`, which connects Search Console)" — and never guess. **When `indexing.md` has `capture_complete: false`**, URLs in its "Not inspected" section have NO verdict: no claim about them (indexed OR not) is Confirmed; the coverage percentage describes only the inspected subset.

### `sitemap_url_not_indexed`
Check: a row in `indexing.md` § "Not indexed" — the URL is in the live sitemap but GSC's verdict is not PASS (coverage states like "Crawled - currently not indexed", "Discovered - currently not indexed", "Duplicate without user-selected canonical").
Severity: `high` for content pages (blog posts, guides, landing pages); `medium` for legal/utility pages.
Recommendation: quote the exact coverage state from the report and match the fix to it — "Discovered - currently not indexed" → strengthen internal links to the page and request indexing in GSC; "Crawled - currently not indexed" → improve content depth/uniqueness (Google saw it and declined); "Duplicate…" → fix the canonical. Never a generic "submit the sitemap" for all three.

### `page_indexing_blocked_gsc`
Check: `indexing.md` row where robots state is `DISALLOWED`, fetch state is not successful, or the coverage state names an explicit block (`noindex`, `Blocked by robots.txt`, `Soft 404`, `Not found (404)`, server error).
Severity: `critical` — Google is actively prevented from indexing a page the sitemap asks it to index.
Recommendation: name the exact blocking mechanism from the report row and where to fix it (robots.txt rule, noindex directive, or the failing fetch), plus "request re-indexing in GSC once fixed".

### `google_canonical_mismatch`
Check: `indexing.md` row where the Google canonical differs from the page URL / user canonical.
Severity: `medium` (`high` when Google's choice is a different domain).
Recommendation: "Google chose `{google_canonical}` as canonical instead of `{url}`. Consolidate: make the duplicates point their canonical at the preferred URL, and internally link only the preferred URL."

### `indexing_coverage_low`
Check: from `indexing.md` frontmatter — `indexed / inspected < 0.5` with at least 5 URLs inspected.
Severity: `high`
Recommendation: "Only {indexed} of {inspected} inspected sitemap URLs are indexed ({pct}%). List the not-indexed URLs (from the report), group by coverage state, and fix by group — this is usually internal-link depth, thin/duplicate content, or a site-wide render problem, not a per-page accident." Cross-reference the `client_rendered_shell` and `page_renders_empty` checks: a client-rendered site is the most common cause of mass "Crawled - currently not indexed".

## Render & Upstream Health

These checks catch the failure mode where a page returns `200 OK` but the body is empty or broken — Google sees a soft 404, you see a green status code, the audit silently passes. Run these on every page audited.

### `page_renders_empty`
Check: WebFetch the page, strip `<nav>`, `<footer>`, `<script>`, `<style>`, `<noscript>`, and visually-hidden elements. Count visible body words. Pass = body word count >= 30 AND a `<h1>` or main heading is present.
Severity: `critical` if the homepage or any sitemap-listed page; `high` for nav-linked pages; `medium` otherwise.
Recommendation: "Page returns 200 OK but renders empty (likely a client-side data fetch is failing — most often a CMS, API, or proxy the page calls is down). Open the network tab in DevTools or grep the codebase for the URL the page fetches. Until fixed, Google treats this as a soft 404 and will deindex the page. See `upstream_dependency_unreachable` below — they almost always go together."

### `upstream_dependency_unreachable`
Check: before auditing pages, use `Grep` to find external URLs the site depends on for content. Specifically search for:
- Cross-subdomain fetch URLs: `https://(blog|api|cms|content|admin|preview)\.{domain}` in `src/`, `app/`, `pages/`, `lib/`, `libs/`, `services/`
- `rewrites:` and `redirects:` blocks in `next.config.js`, `next.config.mjs`, `next.config.ts`, `vercel.json`
- Hardcoded API base URLs in `.env*` and `package.json`

Then WebFetch each unique base URL (and one representative API path if obvious). Pass = 2xx with non-empty body. Fail = 5xx, timeout, HTML error page, or "no healthy upstream"-style response.

Severity: `critical` if the dependency powers indexable pages (blog, docs, listings, product pages); `high` if it powers logged-in flows only; `medium` for purely internal admin tools.

Recommendation: "{dependency_url} returned {status}. The pages it powers ({list}) cannot render content — they will surface as `page_renders_empty`. Either restore the dependency, or move the affected pages to a different publishing target (see Publishing Target Decision in SKILL.md). Don't generate any new content for the affected URL pattern until this is resolved — the briefs and articles will all point at a dead address."

> **Why this check matters:** the most common SEO disaster on a live site is a CMS that's been quietly down for weeks — every page returns 200, the audit looks clean, but Google has been deindexing the blog the whole time. This check catches it on the first audit.

### `client_rendered_shell`
Check: `evidence.md` flags the page as a client-rendered shell — the server HTML is near-empty and/or shows a "Loading…" placeholder with no in-body links. The classic case is a blog index that ships a `Loading…` shell with no post `<a>` links in the server HTML: crawlers (and this fetch) see zero posts.
Severity: `critical` if it's a content-listing / blog-index / indexable page; `high` otherwise.
Recommendation: "This page renders client-side — the server HTML has no content/links, so crawlers can't see it (Confirmed from the crawl). Server-render or pre-render it (SSR/SSG/ISR) so the {posts/listings} are in the initial HTML. Any on-page data on this page (counts, listings) is Likely/Hypothesis until it's server-rendered."

## On-Page SEO

> **Head-level checks MUST use `evidence.md`, not WebFetch.** WebFetch returns a markdown-stripped render that DROPS the entire document `<head>` — so `<title>`, `<meta name="description">`, `<link rel="canonical">`, and every `og:*` / `twitter:*` tag are invisible to it, exactly like `<script>` JSON-LD. "No title / no meta / no canonical / no OG" concluded from WebFetch is a **false negative** that leads to recommending head tags the page already serves (the head-blindness bug). `seoagent crawl` parses the RAW HTML head and `evidence.md` lists each of these per page, plus an explicit **"Already present (do NOT recommend adding)"** line. Read that. **Only flag a head tag as missing when `evidence.md` shows it genuinely absent — never recommend adding a title / meta description / canonical / OG / Twitter tag that already appears in the evidence.**

### `title_missing`
Check: `evidence.md` shows the page's `title` is `_(none)_` (empty or absent). Do NOT conclude "no title" from WebFetch — it strips the head.
Severity: `critical`
Recommendation (only if genuinely absent per evidence): "Add a `<title>` tag. Target 50-60 characters with primary keyword near the start."

### `title_too_long`
Check: title > 60 characters.
Severity: `high`
Recommendation: "Shorten title from {N} to 50-60 characters: `{suggested title}`"

### `title_too_short`
Check: title < 30 characters.
Severity: `medium`
Recommendation: "Title is too short to compete. Expand to 50-60 characters with primary keyword."

### `title_duplicate`
Check: same title across multiple pages in the audit.
Severity: `high`
Recommendation: "Pages {list} all use the same title. Make each unique."

### `meta_description_missing`
Check: `evidence.md` shows the page's `meta description` is `_(none)_`. Do NOT conclude "no meta description" from WebFetch — it strips the head. **Per-page check — blog posts included:** the rollup's *Pages missing meta description* list covers every crawled page; posts missing descriptions while the homepage has one is the common real-world shape, so report each listed URL.
Severity: `medium`
Recommendation (only if genuinely absent per evidence): "Add a meta description, 150-160 chars, includes primary keyword and a soft CTA."

### `meta_description_too_long`
Check: meta description > 160 characters.
Severity: `low`
Recommendation: "Trim meta description from {N} to 150-160 chars: `{suggested}`."

### `social_tags_missing`
Check: `evidence.md` lists the page's `Open Graph` and `Twitter` tags. Do NOT conclude "no OG / no Twitter card" from WebFetch — it strips the head. Pass = at least `og:title` + `og:image` (and ideally `twitter:card`) present in the server HTML.
Severity: `low` (a social-share / CTR gap, not an indexation issue).
Recommendation (only if genuinely absent per evidence): "Add Open Graph (`og:title`, `og:description`, `og:image`, `og:url`) and a `twitter:card` so shared links render a rich preview. **Never recommend adding these if `evidence.md` already lists them** — that's the head-blindness false positive this check exists to stop."

### `h1_missing`
Check: no `<h1>` in the page body.
Severity: `high`
Recommendation: "Add exactly one `<h1>` containing the primary keyword."

### `h1_multiple`
Check: `evidence.md` lists more than one `<h1>` for the page (it captures ALL H1s in document order, so conflicting H1s are detected). Per-page — the rollup's *Pages with multiple H1s* lists every offender across the crawl, subpages included.
Severity: `medium`
Recommendation: "Page has {N} `<h1>`s ({list}). Reduce to one; demote the others to `<h2>`/`<h3>`."

### `heading_hierarchy_skipped`
Check: H1 → H3 with no H2 between, or H2 → H4 with no H3.
Severity: `low`
Recommendation: "Don't skip heading levels. Demote {heading} to {correct level}."

### `url_uppercase`
Check: URL contains uppercase letters.
Severity: `low`
Recommendation: "Use lowercase URLs. Add a lowercase rewrite rule and 301 redirect existing pages."

### `url_underscores`
Check: URL contains underscores.
Severity: `low`
Recommendation: "Replace underscores with hyphens in URL: `{old}` → `{new}` with 301."

## Content Quality

### `word_count_thin`
Check: page word count < 300 (excluding nav, footer, cookie banners).
Severity: `medium` for content pages; skip for utility pages (login, 404, error).
Recommendation: "Add ~{target - current} words of substantive content. Target 800+ for blog posts."

### `keyword_not_in_first_100_words`
Check: primary keyword (from brief if available, inferred from title otherwise) appears in body before word 100.
Severity: `medium`
Recommendation: "Move the primary keyword `{keyword}` into the first paragraph for AI-extractability."

### `images_without_alt`
Check: `evidence.md` — each page section's **images** line (`N total, M missing alt` + the first offending srcs) and the rollup's *Images missing alt* total. The crawl extracts `<img>` tags with no `alt` attribute from the server HTML (`alt=""` on decorative images counts as present). Do NOT conclude alt coverage from WebFetch or repo source — report the counts + srcs the evidence lists, per page.
Severity: `medium` if > 3 images; `low` otherwise.
Recommendation: "Add descriptive alt text to {N} images on {page} (starting with {srcs from evidence}). SEOAgent can write these — `seoagent.js` does it automatically on production."

### `missing_product_screenshots`
Applies only when `project.md` has `site_type: saas` (or the repo renders a real product UI). Check: a landing / feature / how-to page that describes the product but has **no real product screenshot** in its hero or feature sections (illustration-only, stock photo, or no image where a UI shot belongs).
Severity: `low` (a conversion + trust gap, not an indexation issue).
Recommendation: "Add a real product screenshot to the hero + feature sections — read `references/screenshots.md` to capture them from the product's own code in this repo. Real UI shots out-convert AI illustrations on a SaaS page."

### `internal_links_count`
Check: number of `<a>` tags pointing to same-domain URLs in body.
Severity: `medium` if 0 (orphan); `low` if < 3.
Recommendation: "Add internal links to related content. Pillar / sub_pillar pages should link to their cluster siblings."

## Technical Foundations

### `non_https`
Check: any URL on the site uses `http://`.
Severity: `critical` if homepage; `high` otherwise.
Recommendation: "Migrate to HTTPS. Configure a 301 redirect from http:// at the server level."

### `mobile_viewport_missing`
Check: `<meta name="viewport">` absent.
Severity: `high`
Recommendation: "Add `<meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1\">` to `<head>`."

### `mixed_content`
Check: HTTP resources (img, script, css) on an HTTPS page.
Severity: `medium`
Recommendation: "Update {N} resource URLs from http:// to https:// or use protocol-relative paths."

### `core_web_vitals_lcp_poor`
Check: LCP > 2.5s on mobile (via PageSpeed Insights API).
Severity: `high` if > 4s; `medium` if 2.5-4s.
Recommendation: "Largest Contentful Paint is {N}s (target <2.5s). Optimize hero image, defer non-critical CSS, server-side render the above-fold content."

### `core_web_vitals_cls_poor`
Check: CLS > 0.1.
Severity: `high` if > 0.25; `medium` if 0.1-0.25.
Recommendation: "Cumulative Layout Shift is {N} (target <0.1). Reserve space for images and ads, avoid injecting content above existing content."

### `core_web_vitals_inp_poor`
Check: INP > 200ms.
Severity: `medium`
Recommendation: "Interaction to Next Paint is {N}ms (target <200ms). Defer JavaScript, avoid long-running event handlers."

## AI Search Readiness

### `ai_bots_blocked`
Check: robots.txt has `Disallow: /` or `User-agent: GPTBot`/`PerplexityBot`/`ClaudeBot`/`Google-Extended` with `Disallow:`.
Severity: `medium` (intentional for some sites)
Recommendation: "Robots.txt blocks AI crawlers ({list}). If you want to be cited by AI search, allow them. If you want to opt out of AI training, the current rules are correct."

### `no_extractable_answer_block`
Check: page has primary keyword in title/H1 but no paragraph in the first 200 words that directly answers the keyword's intent.
Severity: `medium`
Recommendation: "Lead with a definition or direct answer in the first paragraph (40-80 words) so AI search engines can extract it."

### `llms_txt_missing`
Check: `WebFetch https://{domain}/llms.txt`. It fails the check if it 404s, or returns something that isn't markdown starting with an `#` H1 (a soft-404 / SPA shell).
Severity: `medium`
Recommendation: "Your site serves no `llms.txt` — the markdown map ChatGPT, Claude, Perplexity and AI Overviews read to work out what this site is. `seoagent llms` generates one from your page inventory, published articles and crawl evidence, and publishes it to your static dir; every `seoagent sync` keeps it current after that."
> Fixing this is one command. Run `seoagent llms` — do not hand-write the file, and do not tell the user to; a hand-written one goes stale the moment they publish anything, which is the state this check exists to catch.

### `okf_bundle_missing`
Check: `WebFetch https://{domain}/.well-known/okf/index.md`, then `https://{domain}/okf/index.md`. It passes only if one of them returns markdown whose YAML frontmatter carries a `type:` field. A 200 that renders your app shell is a soft-404 — that is a FAIL, not a pass.
Severity: `medium` (`low` for a purely local/internal site with no answer-engine ambitions)
Recommendation: "Your site publishes no Open Knowledge Format bundle. OKF is Google's format for describing an organization to AI agents: a directory of markdown files answer engines can read wholesale instead of guessing from scraped pages. `.seoagent/okf/` is already scaffolded — fill it (see `references/open-knowledge-format.md`) and `seoagent sync` publishes it to `/.well-known/okf/` automatically."
> **`.seoagent/okf/` existing is NOT a pass.** The check is about what the live site SERVES. A bundle that only exists in `.seoagent/` is invisible to every crawler — that gap is the whole reason this check exists.

### `ai_files_unpublished`
Check: `.seoagent/okf/` has real content (not the scaffold placeholders) but `{domain}/.well-known/okf/index.md` 404s — i.e. the bundle was written and never reached the live site.
Severity: `high` (the work is done and earning nothing)
Recommendation: "The OKF bundle exists in `.seoagent/okf/` but isn't served. Check `public_dir:` in `.seoagent/project.md` points at the directory your framework serves (`public` for Next.js/Vite/Astro, `static` for SvelteKit/Gatsby/Hugo), run `seoagent okf publish`, and commit + deploy the result."

### `faq_section_missing_on_pillar`
Check: page is page_type=pillar but has no `<h2>` containing "FAQ" or "Frequently Asked Questions".
Severity: `low`
Recommendation: "Add an FAQ section with 5-7 H3 questions. Powers FAQ schema and AI Overview citations."

## Schema Markup

> **Schema checks MUST use `evidence.md`, not WebFetch.** WebFetch strips `<script>` tags — it CANNOT see JSON-LD, so "no schema found" from WebFetch is a false negative that leads directly to recommending schema the page already serves. The `seoagent crawl` evidence base parses raw HTML and lists every JSON-LD `@type` present per page. Read that. **Only flag a schema type as missing when `evidence.md` shows it is genuinely absent — never recommend adding a `@type` that already appears in the evidence.**

### `no_json_ld_on_article`
Check: page is a blog article (URL pattern `/blog/*`) AND `evidence.md` shows **no `Article` (or `BlogPosting`/`NewsArticle`) `@type`** for it.
Severity: `medium`
Recommendation (only if genuinely absent): "Add `Article` JSON-LD with headline, author, datePublished, dateModified, image, publisher.logo. See `references/schema-markup.md`."

### `no_organization_schema_on_homepage`
Check: `evidence.md` shows the homepage has **no `Organization` `@type`** (and no `SoftwareApplication`/`WebSite` that would already cover the brand entity). If the evidence lists `Organization`/`SoftwareApplication`, this check PASSES — do not recommend adding it.
Severity: `medium`
Recommendation (only if genuinely absent): "Add `Organization` JSON-LD on homepage with name, url, logo, sameAs links to social profiles."

### `note_schema_detection_limitation`
Schema is verified from `evidence.md` (raw-HTML JSON-LD parse), not WebFetch. If the crawl couldn't run, treat any "no schema" conclusion as `Hypothesis` and tell the user: "Test your pages at https://search.google.com/test/rich-results — I couldn't verify JSON-LD via WebFetch (it strips `<script>` blocks). Run `seoagent crawl` for a verified read."

## Site Architecture

### `orphan_page`
Check: page in sitemap.xml but no internal link points to it from any other audited page.
Severity: `high`
Recommendation: "{N} pages are orphans (no internal links pointing to them). Add internal links from related pages or remove from sitemap."

### `deep_page`
Check: page > 4 clicks from homepage.
Severity: `low`
Recommendation: "Page is {N} clicks deep. Consider promoting it via an internal link from a high-authority page."

### `breadcrumbs_missing`
Check: deep page (> 2 clicks from home) without `BreadcrumbList` schema or visible breadcrumb nav.
Severity: `low`
Recommendation: "Add breadcrumb navigation + BreadcrumbList JSON-LD on deep pages."

## Execution protocol (moved from the skill body — the mechanics behind Phase 1)

### The crawl is the gate for ALL live-state work

Any audit, technical-SEO review, "what's wrong with my site", or "add schema/meta/canonical" request starts with `seoagent crawl` — even a quick one, even when the repo source looks obvious. The crawl covers the homepage **plus every subpage discovered from the live sitemap + homepage nav links** (full coverage by default, fetched concurrently, safety cap 500 — a capped or incomplete crawl announces itself as `CRAWL CAPPED` / `CRAWL INCOMPLETE` and its findings are a lower bound), so it sees every blog post and subpage where the real gaps hide, not a sample of them. **No live-state claim and no "add X" recommendation may be emitted unless `.seoagent/audit/evidence.md` exists, covers the target page(s), and the claim cites it.** If `evidence.md` is missing or stale (>24h old — `seoagent doctor` flags this as `evidence_stale`), re-run the crawl before asserting anything. Reasoning from the repo source about what the live site serves is exactly the failure this gate exists to stop: the repo may be behind (or ahead of) production.

Origin binding rules:

- **If the user/session stated where the live site is** (any phrasing — "the live site is at http://127.0.0.1:4173", "we're on https://staging.example.com", a URL in the task prompt), pass that URL **verbatim** as `seoagent crawl --url <origin>`. A user-designated origin is authoritative even when it's localhost — staging/preview setups are legitimate. The CLI persists it as `live_url:` in `project.md` so later commands reuse it.
- **If no live URL was provided**, use the persisted `live_url:`/`domain:` from `.seoagent/project.md` (the CLI resolves this automatically), or ask the user. If neither exists, `seoagent crawl` errors instead of guessing — resolve the origin, don't work around the error.
- **NEVER start a local dev server yourself and crawl it as the live site.** A dev server renders the repo's current state, which can differ from production in either direction — evidence captured from it would make every "Confirmed absent/present" claim false about the real site. If you crawl an origin the CLI wasn't told is live, `evidence.md` is labeled **SOURCE RENDER (local dev server) — NOT the public live site**, and no live-state claim may be derived from it.

### What the crawl produces

- **`.seoagent/audit/evidence.md`** — the verified evidence base (exact title/meta, ALL H1s, canonical + server/client-render flag, every JSON-LD `@type`, OG/Twitter tags, the ACTUAL robots.txt contents, sitemap URL + blog-post counts, client-rendered-shell detection), with the **crawled origin recorded at the top** — check it matches the site you're auditing. **`Read` that file — every `Confirmed` finding must be derived from it, not from repo source or memory.** (`seoagent crawl --json` gives the structured bundle.)
- **`.seoagent/audit/findings.md`** — a code-built technical findings report: one finding per confirmed issue in the evidence (affected URLs, why it matters, suggested fix, `Confirmed` label, `Evidence:` citation), covering the full surface — missing canonicals, missing meta descriptions, multiple H1s, images without alt (with srcs), pages with no structured data, client-rendered shells, sitemap coverage gaps, robots.txt facts, and broken crawled URLs. **Your audit (`audit/latest.md`) builds on `findings.md`** — carry every finding in it forward (add GSC cross-referencing, prioritization, and strategy on top; re-grade severity with context where justified) and **never re-derive the technical findings from scratch, never truncate the list**. A finding present in `findings.md` but absent from your audit and final summary means the audit is incomplete. Items its "Already present on the live site" section lists must never become "add X" recommendations — when the repo source lacks something the live page serves, the repo source is stale; reconcile the source.

**Incomplete capture = incomplete evidence (check this FIRST).** If `evidence.md` has a **"Pages NOT captured"** section (frontmatter `capture_complete: false`), the crawl discovered pages it could not fetch — every finding and rollup in the evidence is then a **LOWER BOUND, not a complete picture**. Treat it that way explicitly: relay the code-generated "could not be crawled — evidence is incomplete" finding, state in your audit and final summary that N discovered pages were not captured (with their failure reasons), and never treat an uncaptured page as passing any check — no claim about those pages, present OR absent, is Confirmed. If the failures look transient (timeouts/network errors), re-run `seoagent crawl` once before finalizing.

### WebFetch is a false-negative machine for head tags

If `seoagent crawl` couldn't run (offline, no domain), fall back to per-page WebFetch — but **WebFetch returns a markdown-stripped render that DROPS the entire `<head>`**: `<title>`, `<meta name="description">`, `<link rel="canonical">`, every `og:*` / `twitter:*` tag, AND every `<script>` JSON-LD block are all invisible to it. Any "missing title / meta / canonical / OG / schema" conclusion drawn from WebFetch is a **false negative** — never `Confirmed`, and never a basis for recommending you add a head tag the site already serves. That's what `seoagent crawl` (raw-HTML parse) exists to prevent; `evidence.md` even prints an explicit **"Already present (do NOT recommend adding)"** line per page. Use WebFetch only for body-content / render-state signals it can actually see.

### Mechanical enforcement — verify-recs

The evidence-citation contract is enforced by the CLI, not just by the prompt — twice over:

1. Every `seoagent sync` (including the PostToolUse hook that fires after each file write) runs a verify-recs pass first, so false claims in `.seoagent/**/*.md` are corrected as the files are written — when the hook output reports a `verify-recs: corrected …` line, treat it as authoritative and carry the correction into your response.
2. At the end of the session — after writing your outputs, BEFORE composing the final summary — run `seoagent verify-recs` yourself (pass any work-log/summary files you wrote outside `.seoagent/` as arguments), because files outside `.seoagent/` are only checked when you pass them. This is still the MANDATORY final step of any audit/optimization session.

**If `evidence.md` is a SOURCE RENDER (undesignated local dev-server crawl), verify-recs cannot verify live-state claims — it will say so; re-crawl with `--url <live origin>` before finalizing any live-state summary.** It re-checks every authored `.seoagent/**/*.md` against `evidence.md` and REWRITES, in place with a `CORRECTION (verify-recs)` annotation, any "added X / there was no X / X was missing" claim about a head-level entity (title, meta description, canonical, Open Graph, twitter:card, or a JSON-LD `@type` such as `Organization`/`SoftwareApplication`/`WebSite`) that the evidence shows the live page ALREADY serves. **Reflect every correction it reports in your final message** — never let a corrected claim survive into the summary (use `--json` to branch on the result programmatically). The deterministic way to do that: build the final message from `seoagent summary` (see `references/session-protocol.md`), which quotes the corrected on-disk state — including every CORRECTION line — instead of trusting your memory of what you found. It never touches `evidence.md`, generated projections (`pages.md`/`keywords.md`), the inbox, or anything under `.claude/`, and it always exits 0 — a correction is the check working, not an error. **It never rewrites dated history either:** a line authored BEFORE the crawl day (a `[YYYY-MM-DD]`-stamped or dated-heading `changelog.md` entry, or an `audit/latest.md` whose `audited_at:` predates `evidence.md`'s `captured_at`) is a record the re-crawl confirms, not a false claim. verify-recs lists those as **stale** — when it does, note the finding as fixed in the current re-audit (`latest.md` fixed/new/regressed diff); do not edit the old line and do not restate it as an open finding.

### Per-audit passes (run alongside the per-page checks above)

- **Upstream-health pass (mandatory, before per-page checks).** Use `Grep` to find cross-subdomain fetch URLs (`blog.`, `api.`, `cms.`, `content.`) in `src/`, `app/`, `pages/`, `lib/`, `libs/`, `services/`, plus any `rewrites:` / `redirects:` targets in `next.config.{js,mjs,ts}` and `vercel.json`. WebFetch each unique base URL. Anything returning 5xx, timing out, or returning an HTML error page becomes an `upstream_dependency_unreachable` finding (`critical` if it powers indexable content).
- **Render-state pass (mandatory, part of every page check).** After fetching, strip nav/footer/script/style/noscript and count visible body words. If word count < 30, mark `page_renders_empty` (`critical` for homepage or sitemap-listed pages). A 200 OK with empty body is a soft 404 — Google deindexes these. **Shortcut: `seoagent refresh --crawl`** does this pass deterministically for the whole inventory — it fetches every page and fills the `Status` / `Rendered` / `Word count` columns in `.seoagent/pages.md` (a 404/5xx → `error`; a 200 with < 30 body words → `empty`). Run it once at the start of the audit, then read `pages.md` to find the `empty`/`error` rows instead of WebFetching each page by hand. It writes `pages.md` directly (not via your Write tool), so the auto-sync hook won't fire — run `seoagent sync` after it. (No JS execution — a client-rendered SPA with an empty initial HTML reads as `empty`, which is itself the SEO signal to fix with SSR/prerender.)
- **Internal-link pass.** Run `seoagent internal-links` (writes `.seoagent/internal-links.md` with orphan + weakly-linked pages; `--json` for structured output). For each orphan, propose 1–3 specific internal links — a topically-related existing page to link **from** + natural anchor text, chosen via `.seoagent/pages.md` and your read of the content. Fold orphans into the audit (`medium`, category internal-linking). If the user wants, `Edit` the source pages to add the links (safe, reversible — show the diff), then `seoagent sync`. Limitation: the analyzer scans the **repo**, so it can't see links inside CMS-hosted content — note that when the blog is CMS-hosted.
- **Indexing-coverage pass (cloud-connected — run whenever `seoagent whoami` shows a login).** Run `seoagent indexing` — it inspects the live sitemap's URLs with Google Search Console URL Inspection (authoritative verdicts, not inference) and writes `.seoagent/audit/indexing.md`. Fold its findings into the audit per § Indexing Coverage above: sitemap URLs Google has NOT indexed (`high`), pages whose indexing is blocked by robots/noindex per GSC (`critical`), Google-chose-a-different-canonical mismatches (`medium`), and a `high` coverage finding when under half the inspected sitemap URLs are indexed. Findings derived from `indexing.md` rows are `Confirmed` (cite `Evidence: indexing.md § <URL>`); URLs its "Not inspected" section lists have NO verdict — never claim anything about them. **If the CLI is logged out** (`seoagent indexing` says login is required), do NOT guess indexing state — and do NOT use `site:` searches as a substitute (they under-report) — state "indexing coverage not verified (needs the free `seoagent login`, which connects Search Console)" in the audit output and move on.
- **AI-readability pass (always — this is the free tier's sharpest finding).** Two files decide whether ChatGPT, Claude, Perplexity and AI Overviews can describe this site accurately: `/llms.txt` and the OKF bundle at `/.well-known/okf/index.md`. WebFetch both and run `llms_txt_missing`, `okf_bundle_missing`, and `ai_files_unpublished` from this file. Judge what the LIVE SITE SERVES — a bundle sitting in `.seoagent/okf/` that nobody published is a FAIL, and the most common one. Fixing `llms.txt` is a single command (`seoagent llms`); offer to run it in the "What do you want to do?" options rather than describing it.

### After writing the audit

1. Append to `.seoagent/changelog.md`: `[date] Audit completed: {N} pages, {N} findings ({c} critical, {h} high, {m} medium, {l} low)`.
2. Update `.seoagent/roadmap.md` with audit-derived action items grouped by priority.
3. Run `seoagent verify-recs`, then `seoagent sync`.
4. If this is the end of the session, build the final message with `seoagent summary` (see `references/session-protocol.md`) — present its output rather than restating the findings from memory.

**If the audit raises any `critical` finding from `upstream_dependency_unreachable` or `page_renders_empty`**, do not proceed to strategy work. Jump to `references/publishing.md` (Publishing Target Decision) — every keyword, brief, and article generated against a broken publishing path is wasted work.
