# Writing Rules — No AI Slop

Prose-craft rules for EVERY article, landing page, brief, and rewrite this skill produces. Adapted from the `no-ai-slop` skill (github.com/petergyang/no-ai-slop, MIT). The page-type references (pillar, sub-pillar, long-tail, listicle, landing-pages) set the *structure*; this file sets the *sentences*. Load it whenever you draft, edit, or rewrite content.

These rules also ship inside cloud-generated briefs as a "## Writing rules (no AI slop)" section. When a brief carries that section, it is the same contract as this file — don't apply the rules twice, just follow them.

## Language

Write in the site's language — the `language:` value in `project.md` (`nl`, `da`, `de`, `en-GB`…). It applies to everything: headings, meta title and description, FAQ, image alt text, slug words. Brand and product names stay as they are. Cloud briefs carry the same instruction as a `Language:` line in their site context. If `project.md` says `en` but the live site is plainly not in English, fix `project.md` first (`seoagent init` guesses it from the domain's ccTLD; a `.com` site in Dutch needs `language: nl` by hand, an English site on `.nl` needs `language: en-NL`) — the cloud uses that value for keyword data too.

## Banned words

Never use: delve, foster, leverage, utilize, facilitate, empower, streamline, robust, cutting-edge, paradigm shift, game changer, "this is huge", "this changes everything", tapestry, realm, beacon, multifaceted, meticulous, intricate, paramount, transformative, elevate, embark, supercharge, harness, ever-evolving.

## Phrases that delay the point

Cut these and state the point: "it's worth noting", "it's important to note", "at the end of the day", "when it comes to", "at its core", "in today's world", "in the age of", "in the world of", "the reality is", "the truth is", "in terms of", "with regard to", "in order to" (write "to"), "going forward", "in this article", "let's dive in".

## Patterns never to produce

1. **Binary contrasts** — "This is not X. It's Y." / "The question isn't X, it's Y." / "It's not just X but Y." State Y directly: "The eval matters more than the model."
2. **Throat-clearing openers** — "Here's the thing", "Let me be clear", "I'll be honest", "The uncomfortable truth is". Start with the point.
3. **Faux-insight setups** — "What most people get wrong", "Here's what nobody tells you", "The part everyone misses". Make the claim stand on its own.
4. **Colon reveals** — a noun phrase, a colon, then a dramatic reveal ("The best part: it learns"). Write a plain sentence. Colons are for lists, labels, and quotes.
5. **Fake-strong verbs** — "serves as a centralized hub for" → say what it does: "tracks sponsors, drafts, and due dates in one place". Prefer "is" and "has" when they are clearer.
6. **Synonym cycling** — if the clear word is right, repeat it. Don't rotate "the agent / the assistant / the tool" for style.
7. **Negative listing** — "Not a X. Not a Y. A Z." Just say Z.
8. **Dramatic fragmentation** — "X. And Y. And Z." or "That's it. That's the whole thing." Use complete sentences.
9. **Rhetorical setups** — "What if I told you...", "Think about it:", "Plot twist:", self-answered "Question? Answer." pairs. Drop them and make the point.
10. **Interpretive metadiscourse** — "That last part matters more than it sounds", "The key point is", "As you can see", redundant "In other words". If the point is clear, delete the aside; otherwise support it with facts.
11. **Fake-profound kickers** — never end on a cute metaphor, aphorism, or mic-drop line. End on the clearest concrete point, takeaway, or next action.
12. **Summary-recap endings** — no "In conclusion", "Ultimately", "Overall", and no final paragraph that restates the piece.
13. **Weasel attribution** — "Experts agree", "studies show", "industry reports suggest". Name the source or cut the claim. Never invent one.
14. **Robotic rhythm** — avoid repeated sentence shapes, identical paragraph structures, and stacked punchy fragments. Vary sentence length deliberately: put a short sentence next to a long one.

## Concreteness

- **Portability test**: if a sentence could move unchanged to another company, product, or country, it is filler. Cut it or replace it with a fact, number, mechanism, or consequence specific to THIS subject. Never invent specifics; use labeled typical-case ranges when you lack real numbers.
- **Protect the specific fact**: never smooth a useful detail into generic importance. "Significantly improves productivity" → "cut review time from 30 minutes to 8" (real or clearly-labeled numbers only).
- **Show, don't tell**: facts, actions, examples, and consequences carry the emphasis. Cut commentary that labels a point important, surprising, or subtle instead of demonstrating why.
- **Direct verbs**: "made a decision" → "decided"; "has the ability to" → "can".
- **Active voice with human subjects**: "The team shipped it Tuesday" beats "the decision emerged". Never let inanimate things do human verbs.

## Formatting

- Em dashes: at most 1–2 in the whole piece. No clusters, no decorative dashes.
- No emoji in headings or body. No bold sprinkled mid-sentence for emphasis.
- No bullet lists where two sentences of prose read better. No headers over two-sentence sections.

## Editing existing content (rewrites, refreshes, user drafts)

When revising a page that already exists — Phase 4b rewrites, `cli_content_update` inbox actions, or a draft the user wrote — the job changes from "never produce slop" to "remove slop without flattening the voice":

- **Preserve the writer's real voice.** Before editing, note 3–5 voice signals: vocabulary, cadence, bluntness, humor, uncertainty, digressions. Keep the traits that feel personal. Do not make every paragraph equally tidy.
- **Make the minimum effective edit.** Fix slop patterns, errors, and unclear passages. Leave strong human sentences alone. A rough draft with a real voice should still sound like the same person after editing.
- **Keep the user's meaning.** Don't invent claims, examples, stats, or opinions. If something is unclear, ask.
- **Keep useful edge.** Strong opinions, blunt language, humor, and honest admissions stay if they belong to the writer. Don't replace them with safer wording.
- **Keep structure unless it hurts the piece.** If you reorganize, say why in the change summary.
- Empty qualifiers like "I think", "maybe", "to be honest" stay when they express real uncertainty or the writer's spoken rhythm.

## Self-check before showing a draft

After writing or editing, check the draft against this file before you show it or publish it. If a check fails, fix the draft first:

1. No banned words, delay phrases, or listed patterns (unless quoted as examples).
2. Every generic sentence passes the portability test or was cut.
3. Active voice with human subjects where possible; direct verbs.
4. Em dashes ≤ 2; no emoji; no decorative bold; no recap ending.
5. The piece ends on a concrete point, takeaway, or next action.
6. For edits of existing content: the writer would recognize the result as their own voice, and the edit summary lists what changed.
