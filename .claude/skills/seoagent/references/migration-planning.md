# Migration Planning — Legacy Ranking Authority

Loaded when the site has **repositioned** and its historical Google Search Console authority ranks for the *old* story. This is the differentiating capability: a per-asset plan (`seoagent migrate`) that decides, URL by URL, whether to **harvest**, **redirect**, or **sunset** the legacy equity — instead of stranding it or accidentally rebuilding the outdated narrative.

## When to run migration planning

Run it the moment you detect a **positioning shift / legacy-authority mismatch**:

- The live product/positioning (homepage, `context.md`) describes a **different** thing than the site's top GSC queries/pages rank for.
- A **pivot, rebrand, new ICP, or dropped product line** has happened — the user says so, or `keywords --seed` / the audit surfaces high-impression URLs that are off-message for the current direction.
- Phase 2 step 3 ("segment GSC seeds against current positioning") turns up a substantial **legacy / off-strategy** bucket with real impressions — that bucket is exactly what this plan dispositions.

If the site's live direction and its GSC history are aligned, you do **not** need this — normal keyword strategy (Phase 2) covers it. Migration planning is specifically for the mismatch case.

## Inputs

1. **The new direction.** Inferred from `.seoagent/project.md` (domain, `site_type`) + `.seoagent/context.md` (business type, audience, industry, description, writing instructions). Override the summary with `--direction "<what the site is now about>"`.
2. **GSC performance data — real ranking pages/queries with impressions, position, clicks.**
   - **CSV export (no-credentials path — primary).** Search Console → Performance → set the date range → **Export → CSV** → use the **Pages** or **Queries** sheet. The header shape is `Top pages,Clicks,Impressions,CTR,Position` (or `Top queries,...`). Pass it: `seoagent migrate --csv <path>`.
   - **Cloud GSC (`keywords --seed`).** The CLI's other GSC access is query-oriented and projects into `.seoagent/keywords.md`. It's a useful *supplementary* query signal, but for **per-URL page authority** the CSV export is the reliable input — always prefer `--csv` for a real migration plan.

## The harvest / redirect / sunset protocol

For each legacy URL/query cluster with real impressions, the disposition is a function of **(topical relevance to the new direction, impressions, position)**:

| Disposition | Condition | Action |
|---|---|---|
| **harvest** | On-topic for the new direction **and** real impressions | Refresh/repurpose into the new narrative. **Keep the URL**, retarget the content. The equity is bridgeable — reuse it. |
| **redirect** | Off-topic for the new direction **but** holds authority (meaningful impressions and/or a decent position) | **301** into the most relevant new page. Don't throw the authority away — pass it forward. |
| **sunset** | Negligible impressions **or** off-topic with nothing worth preserving | Let it decay / `noindex`. Not worth active migration. |

Default thresholds (`migration-planner.ts`): a row needs ≥ **50 impressions** to count as "worth preserving" (below that, off-topic rows sunset rather than redirect), and must share ≥ **34%** of the direction's vocabulary to count as on-topic. These are deliberate, tunable heuristics — sanity-check the borderline rows.

## Output

`seoagent migrate --csv <path>` writes **`.seoagent/strategy/migration-plan.md`** (created dir if needed):

- Frontmatter counts (`harvest` / `redirect` / `sunset`) + the new-direction summary.
- Per-asset, grouped by disposition: the URL/query, the **GSC evidence** (impressions, clicks, avg position), the **rationale**, and the **concrete action** — each as a `- [ ]` checkbox so it's trackable.
- A **"Redirect config (proposed — approval-gated)"** block listing the `redirect` pages as `source -> <choose the closest new page>` pairs.

**Surface a concise summary in the audit/operator output** — e.g. *"Migration plan: 6 harvest · 4 redirect · 11 sunset across 21 legacy assets → `.seoagent/strategy/migration-plan.md`."*

## Applying redirects (approval-gated)

The proposed 301s are **never applied silently**. If the repo can express redirects as config (a redirects list, `next.config.js` `redirects()`, a `vercel.json` `redirects` array, `_redirects`, etc.):

1. Pick the target new page for each `redirect` row (the closest topical match in the current site).
2. **Show the diff** of the config change before writing — consistent with the skill's plan-then-execute / approval model.
3. Only write after the user confirms.

Harvest actions (refresh/repurpose) flow through the normal rewrite protocol (`references/rewrite-protocol.md`); sunset actions are usually just a `noindex` or removal from the sitemap — also propose, don't auto-apply.

## Relationship to keyword strategy

Migration planning is the **backward-looking** counterpart to Phase 2's forward-looking clusters. Run `keywords --seed` to see the historical demand, split on/off strategy (Phase 2 step 3), then use `seoagent migrate` to give the **off-strategy-but-valuable** bucket a concrete per-URL disposition. The new direction's forward clusters still come from `context.md` + WebSearch (they have little GSC history yet).

## Do you actually have GSC data? Check before concluding "no"

"No GSC data" is the wrong conclusion far too often. Two sources count, and the second is easy to miss:

1. **A connected login** — `seoagent whoami` shows the account and GSC connection.
2. **A local Search Console CSV export.** `seoagent migrate` auto-detects `gsc/*.csv` and CSVs in the repo root. A user who exported from Search Console and dropped the file in the repo has GSC data even with no login at all.

Check both before deciding the migration path does not apply. Only when neither exists do you skip migration silently.
